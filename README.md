# TAK-Game
In this project, I implemented the TAK game with the Prolog programming language.

# Conditions
At the beginning of the game, the screen is empty and each player can do one of these moves in his turn:
1. Place a bead of its own color in one of the empty spaces on the table.
2. Put a piece of its own color on the previous pieces in a non-empty house on the table.
3. Choose one of the non-empty houses of the table whose highest tile is of its own color and move the tiles of that house (keeping the order) to the other houses of the table.
